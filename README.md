# SplatRandomiser
This was a small project meant to be shared amongst my friends who all play the video game Splatoon 2.

The game has a large selection of weapons to use, but when overwhelmed with choice, we wanted a way to have random weapons to be picked for us. Thus I decided to create a web app that does exactly that, and made it accessible on the browser, so my friends could easily run it themselves.

To run the web app, simply open your preferred web browser and enter this address: https://jamesomckenna.github.io/SplatRandomiser/

Enjoy!
